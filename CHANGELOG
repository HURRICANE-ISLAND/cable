v3.12 o fix bug in branched problems with detection of second BC
      o revert to previous B0=0 boundary BC 
      o fix bug in current evaluation at wrong coordinates in 3D dynamics
      o add progress save and restart for dynamic problems (3D only for moment)
      o make shooting horizontal a one loop operation
      o fix bug in 3D static coordinate integration across 
        connectors with spools
      o fix bug in debug output of connectors with positions or thrust  

v3.11 o fix bug remapping dynamic -> static on dynstat option
      o fix bug where Sn and Sb were not written as dynamic quantities
      o added node s coordinate, s, as a variable (can be function of 
        node number)
      o added node number, n, as a variable
      o variable smoothing can now be function of time
      o re-do new thrust output to be its own thing rather than an add-on
        to time-series output. Use -ext_dt to specify timestep.
      o fix a bug with atan2 parsing (it wasn't there). Add acos and asin too
      o reinstate syntax error output on parse errors
      o prelim support (not well tested) for xthrust output in result file
      o -connectors option now includes nodes on both sides of connector
        in output
    

v3.10 o rewrote variable expression handling for filtering, node
        references, many more available variables, general 
        availability of all variables on layout expressions, etc.

v3.09 o fix bug in 3D Sn/Sb calc from shooting across connectors with 
        top-spool preceding
      o add x,y,z,u,v,w to available variables for -thrust
      o add ability to specify additional connector parameters (position,
        force, thrust)

            connector = {
                body = CONNECTOR_NAME
                x = INITIAL_X_position
                x-thrust = THRUST_EXPRESSION
             }
            
             old style still allowed:

             connector = CONNECTOR_NAME
             connector = pinned
             connector = spliced (same as no connector)

      o lengthened copy buffer for text variable expressions to 64k (from 2k)
v3.08 o more payout fixes, pay out and in stretched lengths
      o add seg_dt option and new results format of segment data 
      o fix some 2D/3D naming problems in res2mat velocities
v3.07 o fixes bugs in payout and finish support for payout in 3D
      o add horizontal-drifter problem type
      o add static-outer-method fixed/variable to adaptively control outer
            relaxation
      o add current-file option to specify a 4D grid of current in the form
        
            dt min_t nt dz min_z nz dx min_x nx dy min_y ny
            Ux(1) Uy(1) Uz(1) ... 

            The array is ordered/indexed as U(t,y,x,z) so that the first 
            entries are the current profile starting at min_z going to max_z 
            at min_t, min_x, min_y. Then shift over to the profile at 
            min_x + dx, etc. Then repeat that for all the profile at 
            min_t, min_y + dy, etc.

v3.06 o adds support for rotating a current profile.
v3.04 o adds support for scaling an entire current profile 
      o add static-outer-method option to use secant or bisection in draft outer
      o new access to advanced analysis parameter control of 
            dynamic integration method
            static solution method.
v3.03 o fixes a bug in the results display for solutions loaded from file,
            causing forces and tensions to be underreported by 4.448.

o added mu= and safety= to terminal definitions for anchor drag in 
  static problems
o added swl= and yield= to material definition for tension checks
